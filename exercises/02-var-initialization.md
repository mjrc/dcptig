# 02. Variable initialization 

The goal of this exercise is to build a Hello World program by printing variable values.  

- Import and use package `fmt`
- Initialize a `foo` and `bar` variable
- The string value `Hello` should be assigned to the variable `foo` 
- The string value `World` should be returned from a function and assigned to the variable `bar` 
- Print the variables `foo` and `bar` to the standard output making `Hello World` again
