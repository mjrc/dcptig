# 03. Struct initialization 

The goal of this exercise is to print `Hello World` using a special greeter type which we define ourselves.

- Build a Hello World example by accessing struct properties
- Make a `greeter` type which has an `Expression` and `Subject` property
- Set the string `Hello` to the `Expression` struct property
- Set the string `World` to the `Subject` struct property   
- Import and use package `fmt` 
- Use the short variable declaration to initialize from the `greeter` type  
- Print the string `Hello World!` by using this variable
